___
## BY TEMITOPE KOLA

## INTRODUCTION
___
Understanding traffic crashes is more than just numbersâ€”it's about uncovering patterns and learning from them. This analysis dives into key factors like crash timing, weather conditions, and human behavior to highlight where risks are highest and how we can make our roads safer. This dateset was gotten from kaggle.

____

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

____
The purpose of this analysis is to Understand the factors contributing to accidents (e.g., weather, lighting, road conditions) to inform traffic safety measures and Analyze accident trends, types, and the severity of injuries across different locations, time periods, and conditions.

I am interested in finding out;
* days with more crash
*  crash severity
*  primary contributions to crash
*  crash trend over time

___

This dashboard has a single report page.

___

I am interested in finding out;
* days with more crash
*  crash severity
*  primary contributions to crash
*  crash trend over time

  But first a quick insight into the key performance indicators

___

 Over 80,000 individuals sustained injuries, with crashes peaking at 5 PM. Fridays stand out as the day with the highest number of incidents, and traffic signals are the most commonly impacted control devices.

 This highlights the need to stay extra cautious during these times and places.
