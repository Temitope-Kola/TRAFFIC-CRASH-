# TRAFFIC CRASH INSIGHT ANALYSIS
___
## BY DEBORAH KOLA ADEMOLA

___

## INTRODUCTION
___
Understanding traffic crashes is more than just numbersâ€”it's about uncovering patterns and learning from them. This analysis dives into key factors like crash timing, weather conditions, and human behavior to highlight where risks are highest and how we can make our roads safer. This dateset was gotten from kaggle.

____

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

____
The purpose of this analysis is to Understand the factors contributing to accidents (e.g., weather, lighting, road conditions) to inform traffic safety measures and Analyze accident trends, types, and the severity of injuries across different locations, time periods, and conditions.

I am interested in finding out;
* days with more crash
*  crash severity
*  primary contributions to crash
*  crash trend over time
*  crashes by weather condition

## DATA SOURCING

___

This data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

Link to [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/traffic-accidents/data)

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
___

While working on this dataset, I did intense data cleaning, and visualization using Excel.

___
## DATA CLEANING

The dataset was very dirty with many data quality issue. I downloaded the file and converted to Excel format where I cleaned it using different excel functions.

Most numeric data were stored as text but I was able to convert them to their appropriate formats, I was also able to detect  blanks and inconsitencies using Filter along side other complex functions in Excel.

___

This dashboard has a single report page.

___

I am interested in finding out;
*  crash severity
*  primary contributions to crash
*  crash trend over time
*  crash by weather condition

  But first a quick insight into the key performance indicators

___

 Over 80,000 individuals sustained injuries, with crashes peaking at 5 PM. Fridays stand out as the day with the highest number of incidents, and traffic signals are the most commonly impacted control devices.

 This highlights the need to stay extra cautious during these times and places.

 ___

*  # crash severity

![imahe alt](https://github.com/Temitope-Kola/TRAFFIC-CRASH-/blob/main/IMAGESS/CRASH_SEVERITY.png?raw=true)

* ## Insights:
Majority of crashes (154,767) show no indication of injury, while others result in varying levels of harm.
Severe injuries include 6,563 incapacitating injuries and 351 fatal cases.

* ## Observation:
  While most crashes are minor, the fatal and severe injury numbers highlight the need for safety interventions.

  ___

* # primary contributions to crash

![imahe alt](https://github.com/Temitope-Kola/TRAFFIC-CRASH-/blob/main/IMAGESS/PRIM%20CONTRI.%20CAUSE.png?raw=true)

* ## Insights:
The top contributors include:
* Unable to determine: 58,310 incidents.
* Failing to yield right-of-way: 42,909 incidents.
* Following too closely: 19,074 incidents.

  
* ## Observation:
* Driver behavior and decision-making are significant contributors to crashes, with "unable to determine" possibly indicating poor documentation or unclear causation.


___

*  # crash trend over time

![imahe alt](https://github.com/Temitope-Kola/TRAFFIC-CRASH-/blob/main/IMAGESS/CRASHTREND%20OVERTIME.png?raw=true)

* ## Insight:
  There has been a fluctuating trend in crashes, with recent years showing a decline.

  
* ## Observation:
 The decrease may indicate improved safety measures or reduced travel volumes during certain periods (e.g., pandemic-related restrictions).
___

* # crash by weather condtion

![image alt](https://github.com/Temitope-Kola/TRAFFIC-CRASH-/blob/main/IMAGESS/weahter%20condition.png?raw=true)

* ## Insights:
Clear weather accounts for 85% of crashes, while cloudy/overcast and rain conditions contribute 11% and 4%, respectively.


* ## Observation:
Most crashes happen under favorable weather conditions, suggesting factors other than weather (e.g., driver behavior, road conditions).
___

## CONCLUSION

To reduce traffic crashes and injuries:

* Driver Behavior: Improve compliance through public education campaigns on signal adherence and defensive driving.
* Traffic Signal Improvements: Enhance visibility and maintenance of traffic control devices.
* Peak Traffic Management: Implement measures to alleviate congestion during rush hours, such as staggered work hours or better public transport options.
